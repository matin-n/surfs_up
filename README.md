# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze Oahu's temperature data for June and December to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. W. Avy and the investors want to open a surf shop and have requested information about temperature trends. Additionally, I have created an API to allow W. Avy and the board of directors to access the analysis easily. The endpoints show the Precipitation, Stations, Monthly Temperature, and Statistics.


## Results
### Summary Statistics
As expected, the December temperatures is lower when compared to June as the Winter season has colder climate conditions and the Summer season has warmer climate conditions.
